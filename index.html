    <h1>My Top 5 Favorite Cities That I've visited!</h1>
    <p id="introParagraph">While I have lived in St. Louis for my entire life, I have always been in love with the idea of traveling. Over
        the past few years I have had the pleasure of traveling to several different cities all over the country. While
        I won't cover everywhere that I have been, this page will describe my 5 favorite cities that I have ever been
        to.</p>

    <h2><a href="https://washington.org/">Washington D.C.</a></h2>
    <p>Back in August 2019, I actually got onto a plane for the first time to travel to Washington D.C.. I traveledd
        with a couple of friends to go to the Pokemon World Champinonships. While I didn't actually compete, I did spend
        plenty of quality time with friends I hadn't seen in months, some in years. I spent a majority of the time
        sightseeing &amp visiting famous landmarks such as The Capitol Building as show in the picture below &amp trying
        out plenty of local resturaunts.</p>

    <h2><a href="http://www.houstontx.gov/">Houston, TX</a></h2>
    <p>So the first time that I actually left the St. Louis area was when I was 4 and I went to Houston with my family.
        We took a 12 hour road trip through the majority of Tornado Valley for my Oldest aunt's wedding. While I don't
        remeber a lot about the original trip, I have been back on several occasions, &amp plan on going back in October
        for my cousin's birthday.</p>

    <h2><a href="https://www.cityofmadison.com/">Madison, WI</a></h2>
    <p>While it might not sound like a very interesting destination, Madison Wisconson is actually a great idea for a
        vacation with friends. I've gone at least once a year for the past few years for local Pokemon events. I would
        highly recommend going to the resturaunt called The Marketplace, or enjoying the sunset at Lake Monana.</p>

    <h2><a href="https://www.visitindy.com/">Indianapolis, IN</a></h2>
    <p>By far my favorite midwest city has to be Indianapolis. My friends &amp I have made it a yearly tradition to
        visit Indy at least once a year since I was 17. One of the funniest moments in my life happened in Indy; which
        was when I had to find an "inebriated" friend of mine who was wondering around downtown. When we finally found
        him, he was at Denny's, but somehow had lost his shoes.</p>

    <h2><a href="https://www.choosechicago.com/">Chicago, IL</a></h2>
    <p>Last, but not least on this list is the Windy City, Chicago. While I have only actually been there once, it will
        always stand out as one of the most enjoyable trips that I have ever taken. In one day I saw The Blue Man Group,
        visited Navy Pier, won $1,200 at a casino, &amp helped a buddy of mine meet his now wife.</p>
