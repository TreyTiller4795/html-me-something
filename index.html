    <h1>My Top 5 Favorite Cities that I've visited!</h1>
    <p>While I have lived in St. Louis for my entire life, I have always been in love with the idea of traveling. Over the past few years I have had the pleasure of traveling to several different cities all over the country. While I won't cover everywhere that I have been, this page will describe my 5 favorite cities that I have ever been to.</p>

    <h2>Washington D.C.</h2>
    <p>Back in August 2019, I actually got onto a plane for the first time to travel to Washington D.C.. I traveledd with a couple of friends to go to the Pokemon WOrld Champinonships. While I didn't actually compete, I did spend plenty of quality time with friends I hadn't seen in months, some in years. I spent a majority of the time sightseeing and visiting famous landmarks such as The Capitol Building as show in the picture below and trying out plenty of local resturaunts.</p>
